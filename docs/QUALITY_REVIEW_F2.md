## 🔍 REVIEW FINDINGS

### 1. Go Code Quality
- [x] **Orchestrator (`agent-loop`)**: Uses `sync.Mutex` for thread-safe model tracking. Implements structured logging for status updates.
- [x] **CLI (`biometrics`)**: Fixed missing `shutdown` package dependency. Implemented native signal handling for graceful shutdown.
- [x] **Error Handling**: Explicit error checks implemented in all new Go logic.
- [x] **Build**: Both `agent-loop` and `biometrics` binaries compile successfully.

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
- [x] **`enterprise-gatekeeper.yml`**: Fully implemented with parallel jobs for Go and Next.js.
- [x] **Compliance**: Includes strict format checks, static analysis (`go vet`), and build tests.

### 3. Configuration & Models
- [x] **`opencode.json`**: Optimized with Gemini 3.1 Pro (Tools/Thinker) and Flash models.
- [x] **`oh-my-opencode.json`**: Role-based model assignment verified.
- [x] **Selectability**: Custom agents ("Delqhi", "td-agent") correctly registered.

### 4. Enterprise Standards
- [x] **PNPM**: Enforcement verified in README and workflows.
- [x] **Machine-Readable**: No emojis in system files or logs.
- [x] **Pathing**: Absolute path mandates followed.
